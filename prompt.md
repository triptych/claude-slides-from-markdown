# Markdown to Slideshow Web Tool

Create a web-based tool that converts markdown content into an interactive slideshow format.

## Core Functionality

- Provide a split view with a markdown editor on the left and a real-time slideshow preview on the right
- Accept markdown content input in the editor, either by typing directly or loading from a markdown file
- Convert the provided markdown into a slideshow format using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- The markdown content should be split into individual slides based on horizontal rules (---) or heading elements (e.g. ## Slide Title)
- Support common markdown elements on slides:
  - Headings (H1 to H6)
  - Paragraphs
  - Lists (ordered and unordered)
  - Links
  - Images
  - Code blocks with syntax highlighting
  - Blockquotes
  - Emphasis (bold, italic)
- Provide navigation controls to move between slides (Previous and Next buttons, keyboard arrow shortcuts)
- Allow entering fullscreen presentation mode
- Enable exporting the generated slideshow as a self-contained HTML file for offline use
- Apply clean, professional, and responsive styling to the slideshow

## Technical Details

- Implement the tool using standard web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Leverage an existing library like Marked for converting markdown to HTML
- Use client-side JavaScript to handle slide generation, navigation, and other interactive features
- Organize code into modular, reusable functions
- Provide clear comments explaining key functionality
- Use meaningful CSS class names and selectors for styling
- Ensure the tool works well across modern web browsers
- Include a README file with setup instructions, usage guidelines, and implementation notes

## Potential Enhancements

- Add support for speaker notes that are visible in presenter mode but not in the main slideshow view
- Allow customizing the slide theme or transition animations
- Explore options for exporting to additional formats like PDF
- Consider integrating interactive elements like polls or quizzes on slides
- Investigate possibilities for real-time collaboration features

The project should be approachable for frontend developers of varying skill levels while showcasing your abilities in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and user experience design. The emphasis should be on creating a practical, functional, and visually appealing tool that provides a convenient workflow for converting markdown into engaging slideshows.
